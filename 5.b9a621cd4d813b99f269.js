In 1997, Coca-Cola offered buying from vending machines using mobile payments.After that PayPal emerged in 1998.Other systems followed suit, such as e-gold, but it faced issues because it was used by criminals and was closed by U.S Department of Justice in 2005.In 2008, bitcoin was introduced, which marked the start of digital currencies. Origins of digital currencies date back to the 1990s Dot-com bubble. One of the first was E-gold, founded in 1996 and backed by gold. Another known digital currency service was Liberty Reserve, founded in 2006; it lets users convert dollars or euros to Liberty Reserve Dollars or Euros, and exchange them freely with one another at a 1% fee. Both services were centralized, reputed to be used for money laundering, and inevitably shut down by the U.S. government.Q coins or QQ coins, were used as a type of commodity-based digital currency on Tencent QQ's messaging platform and emerged in early 2005. Q coins were so effective in China that they were said to have had a destabilizing effect on the Chinese Yuan currency due to speculation.Recent interest in cryptocurrencies has prompted renewed interest in digital currencies, with bitcoin, introduced in 2008, becoming the most widely used and accepted digital currency."]))],null,null)}var u=l["\u0275ccf"]("app-about-me",i,function(e){return l["\u0275vid"](0,[(e()(),l["\u0275eld"](0,0,null,null,1,"app-about-me",[],null,null,null,c,a)),l["\u0275did"](1,114688,null,0,i,[],null,null)],function(e,n){e(n,1,0)},null)},{},{},[]),s=t("Ip0R"),d=t("ZYCi"),y=function(){};t.d(n,"AboutModuleNgFactory",function(){return h});var h=l["\u0275cmf"](r,[],function(e){return l["\u0275mod"]([l["\u0275mpd"](512,l.ComponentFactoryResolver,l["\u0275CodegenComponentFactoryResolver"],[[8,[o.a,u]],[3,l.ComponentFactoryResolver],l.NgModuleRef]),l["\u0275mpd"](4608,s.n,s.m,[l.LOCALE_ID,[2,s.v]]),l["\u0275mpd"](1073742336,s.c,s.c,[]),l["\u0275mpd"](1073742336,d.r,d.r,[[2,d.x],[2,d.o]]),l["\u0275mpd"](1073742336,y,y,[]),l["\u0275mpd"](1073742336,r,r,[]),l["\u0275mpd"](1024,d.m,function(){return[[{path:"",component:i}]]},[])])})}}]);
